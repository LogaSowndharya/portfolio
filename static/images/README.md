# Profile Image Directory

Please add your profile image here:

1. **profile.jpg** - Your professional profile photo

## How to Add Your Photo:

1. Copy your profile image to this `static/images/` directory
2. Name it exactly: `profile.jpg`
3. Recommended specifications:
   - **Size**: 400x400 pixels or larger
   - **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - **Aspect Ratio**: Square (1:1) works best
   - **File Size**: Under 1MB for faster loading

## Fallback Behavior:

If the image fails to load, the portfolio will automatically show your initials "LS" as a fallback with a gradient background.

## Testing:

After adding your image:
1. Run the Django development server
2. Visit the About section of your portfolio
3. Check if your profile image displays correctly
4. Test on different screen sizes to ensure it looks good

## Tips for Best Results:

- Use a high-quality, professional photo
- Ensure good lighting and clear visibility of your face
- Consider a neutral background
- Crop the image to focus on your head and shoulders
- Test the image on both light and dark backgrounds
